{"name":"Straight Away to Orion","tagline":"a visualization of exoplanetary systems as small multiples and in 3D","body":"# Welcome!\r\nWelcome to the homepage of my second project of Fall 2013 Semester, Straight Away to Orion, project 2 of Professor [Andy Johnson](http://www.evl.uic.edu/aej/)'s [Computer Graphics II](http://www.evl.uic.edu/aej/526/) course.\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nGenerally speaking, this app (when running on CAVE2) allows you to:\r\n1. view at most 48 small multiples of different planetary systems at a time, with the ability to scale size of start and planets as well as orbit distance.\r\n2. view our solar system and one other system running in 3D with same scale change ability.\r\n3. select to show four pre-defined interesting sets of planetary systems as small multiples, and filter what to show based on multiple parameters.\r\n4. select from small multiples to move to show in 3D with our solar system for comparison\r\n5. view a simple 3D universe model to see where all the planetary systems are relative to us\r\n6. read information of different planetary systems as well as newly scientific discoveries\r\n\r\nSee [detailed desciption](features.html) for all the features.\r\n\r\n### Download and Install\r\n1. have omegalib installed.\r\n2. download the source code from Github or on top of this page\r\n3. to run the project, do as following:\r\n$ >cd [omegalib_build]/bin/\r\n$ >./orun -s [where_you_put_the_project]/shiyin-p1.py\r\n\r\nNote that to have the best performance from this app, you need to run it on CAVE2. You can buy one [here](http://www.mechdyne.com/cave2.aspx)\r\n\r\n### About the Data\r\nData used in this project is coming from different sources, including but not limiting to\r\n\r\n* [Exoplanet Data Explorer](http://exoplanets.org/table?datasets=explorer)\r\n* [NASA Exoplanet Archive](http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu)\r\n* [Open Exoplanet Catalogue](http://www.openexoplanetcatalogue.com/index.php)\r\n* [Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia](http://exoplanet.eu)\r\n* [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org)\r\n\r\n[More info](data.html) about the Data\r\n\r\n### Interesting Findings\r\nUsing this app, we are able to look into the data and discover things. See [more info](findings.html) about what I found\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
